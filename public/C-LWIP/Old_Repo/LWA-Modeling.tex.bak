\section{System Model}
The performance benefits by aggregating LTE and Wi-Fi links for efficient LWIP architecture can be modeled using queueing theory. The radio links process incoming packets which arrive from higher protocol layers in the uplink and lower layers in the uplink. LTE and Wi-Fi process packets in different service rate, hence can be modeled as two heterogeneous service channels for the incoming packets in the queue. Assume the inter arrival time between successive packets and duration between two consecutive service follow a Poisson distribution. Hence, the arrival rate and service rate follow Exponential distribution. Consider the packet arrival rate is $\lambda$. Service rates of LTE and Wi-Fi are $\mu_{lte}$ and $\mu_{wifi}$, respectively. LTE and Wi-Fi links imitate two heterogeneous servers. Consider there are $n$ users in the network, where $m$ users are served by LWIP node, $m \in [0,n-1]$. Rest $(n-m)$ users contend for the channel in Wi-Fi link. 

\subsection{Increase in throughput because of WoD-Saturated Throughput case}
According to~\cite{} When 'N' nodes are in the network then, Probability of a transmission is given by
\begin{equation}
P_{tr}=1-(1-\tau)^{n}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P_{s}=\frac{n \tau (1-\tau)^{n-1}}{P_{tr}}
\end{equation}
A node transmits with a probability $\tau$. In case of Wi-Fi only in Downlink the number of node contending for the channel gets reduced, which leads to reduction in collision. This is only feasible if there is a secondary carrier like LTE to take the uplink data. The probability of success when only 'm' nodes are contending is given by.
\begin{equation}
P^{WoD}_{tr}=1-(1-\tau)^{n-m}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P^{WoD}_{s}=\frac{(n-m) \tau (1-\tau)^{n-m-1}}{P^{WoD}_{tr}}
\end{equation}
\textbf{Lemma 1 :} Effective improvement in probability of success will be
\begin{equation}
P_{s}^{inc}=P_{s}^{WoD}-P_{s}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P^{inc}_{s}=\frac{(n-m)\tau(1-\tau)^{n-m-1}\big( P_{tr}^{WoD} m (1-\tau)^m -P_{tr}\big)}{P_{tr} P_{tr}^{WoD}}
\end{equation}
\textbf{Corollary 1:}
In WoD, when $m > 1$ and $\tau \geq \tau_{n-m}^{sat}$, makes $P_{tr}^{WoD} m (1-\tau)^m -P_{tr}$ to be greater than zero, will lead $P^{inc}_{s}$ to be strictly a positive quantity. $\tau_{n-m}^{sat}$ corresponds to $\tau$ value for which $(n-m)$ devices achieve maximum throughput.
\par Saturated system throughput when $n$ nodes content for the channel is given by
\begin{equation}
S_{wi-fi}=\frac{P_{s} P_{tr} E[P]}{(1-P_{tr})\sigma + P_{tr} P_{s} T_{s} + P_{tr}(1-P_{s})T_{c}}
\end{equation}
Where $\sigma$ corresponds to empty slot time, $T_{s}$ corresponds to average time (slots) when channel is sensed busy and $T_{c}$ is the average time (slots) channel is busy due to collision. $E[P]$ is the average payload size in slots. 
System throughput in WoD is given by
\begin{equation}
S_{WoD}=\frac{P_{s}^{WoD} P_{tr}^{WoD} E[P]}{(1-P_{tr}^{WoD})\sigma + P_{tr}^{WoD} P_{s}^{WoD} T_{s} + P_{tr}^{WoD}(1-P_{s})T_{c}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{When to use WoD in Non saturated Case}
\subsubsection{Downlink Analysis}
Downlink service rate of WoD and regular Wi-Fi is given by $\mu_{wi-fi}, \mu_{WoD}$. It is assumed that there is equal downlink traffic arrival on LTE and Wi-Fi interface $\lambda_{LTE}=\lambda_{wi-fi}=\lambda$. Naive LAS and WoD LAS could be thought of two parallel server serving with individual queue (M/M/1 N/FIFO). Average System waiting time of both the scheme in downlink will be.
\begin{equation}
W_{NLAS}^{DL}=\frac{1}{2}\big[ W_{LTE} + W_{Wi-Fi}\big]
\label{WifiDL}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
W_{WoD}^{DL}=\frac{1}{2}\big[ W_{LTE} + W^{'}_{Wi-Fi}\big]
\end{equation}
\begin{center}
$W_{LTE}= \frac{P_{o}	\Big[ \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} - \frac{(N+1)\rho^{N+1}}{1-\rho^{(N+1)}}\Big]}{\mu_{LTE}(1-P_{o})}$
\end{center}

$\rho_{lte}=\frac{\lambda}{\mu_{lte}}$, similarly $W_{Wi-Fi} and W_{Wi-Fi}^{'}$ are obtained.  $P_{o}=\frac{1-\rho}{1-\rho^{N+1}}$
\subsubsection{Uplink Analysis}
In case of WoD the uplink is handled by only LTE. The arrival to Wi-Fi interface are redirected to LTE.  Hence the arrival rate for that interface is has became $2\lambda$.

\begin{equation}
W_{WoD}^{UL}= \frac{P_{o}	\Big[ \frac{2\rho}{1-2\rho} - \frac{(N+1)(2\rho)^{N+1}}{1-(2\rho)^{(N+1)}}\Big]}{\mu_{LTE}(1-P_{o})}
\end{equation}
It is reasonable to assume that every nodes queue gets served in uplink at the rate of \big($\frac{\mu_{lte}}{m}$\big) in a scheduled environment with $m$ nodes. Hence, the waiting time of the system in $W_{NLAS}^{UL}$ is same as equation~\ref{WifiDL}.
 
\subsubsection{Delay saving in DL and UL}
\begin{equation}
D_{DL}=W_{NLAS}^{DL} - W_{WoD}^{DL} = \frac{1}{2}\Big[ W_{Wi-Fi} - W_{Wi-Fi}^{'}\Big]
\end{equation}
It is clear that WoD will have lesser delay compared to NLAS in downlink i.e.,$D_{DL}\geq0$. Since the waiting time is inversely affected by service rate $\mu$, and $\mu_{WoD} > \mu_{wi-fi}$. on the other hand NLAS will have lesser delay compared to WoD in uplink. 
\begin{equation}
D_{UL}=W_{WoD}^{UL} - W_{NLAS}^{UL} = =W_{WoD}^{UL} - \frac{1}{2}\Big[W_{LTE} + W_{Wi-Fi}\Big]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{When to Use WoD}
Wi-Fi only in downlink is preferable compared to NLAS only when
\begin{equation}
D_{DL}+D_{UL}>0
\end{equation}
WoD will outperform NLAS for a given $\lambda$, only when the number of non contending users $m$ increases. The minimum $m$ number of Nodes that has to use Wi-Fi only in downlink, which ensures that total system waiting time of WoD in lesser than Naive Link Aggregation strategy. System waiting time in WoD
\begin{equation}
a
\end{equation}

Typically in a network downlink traffic is higher than uplink data requirement. This favors WoD to be a better traffic steering solution for LTE-Wi-Fi aggregation. this problem becomes more interesting if varying arrival rate is considered, which we make it as future work.
